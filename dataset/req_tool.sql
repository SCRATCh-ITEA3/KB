It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: “How does this affect me?” It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact.

If the device is not going to be easily accessible during normal operation, consider providing such a sticker inside the manual or quick start guide, which can be taken out and put somewhere the user will not forget. Of course, there will always be scenarios where customers forget or lose passwords, so system recovery methods, such as a physical reset button which enters a password recovery mode when pressed, should also be securely implemented. Any secret (symmetric) or private (asymmetric) cryptographic keys should also be managed as unique for each device or application. There are a few ways in which cryptographic keys can be determined even when they are apparently being stored and managed inside a secure device.

For such reasons, strategic threats require strategic mitigation technologies. Security analytics can leverage security telemetry from devices and network hardware to help provide an understanding of what is happening in the environment, including detection of stealthier threats. Equally importantly, “monitoring” and analytics can often be deployed as an interim solution in environments where upgrading devices to conform to the first three cornerstones above will take years. Examples of such environments include legacy devices such as industrial control systems (manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities) that cannot be modified until an end-to-end replacement system is ready, automotive cars already on the road whose deeply embedded microcontrollers obviously cannot be “torn out and replaced,” and healthcare environments where suppliers prohibit hospitals from modifying the equipment to add security. In such cases, anomaly detection solutions can be extremely valuable. The deterministic nature of many IoT networks allows the system to be baselined and deviations quickly identified. The wide variety of industrial and IoT protocols can make the problem harder, but newer techniques using advanced machine learning can allow the problem to be solved.

Input from an embedded device cannot be solely relied on to produce good random numbers. It is often best to take input from various sources. One of these may be a standard random function, but other sources also include the least significant bits of an A/D input, network traffic timing, hard-disk seek timing, millisecond data from a real-time clock source, user input timing, etc. These can then be combined and provided as a seed to a pseudo-random number generator, such as those outlined in NIST SP 800-90A.', 3),

These features can be used by the software to help secure assets within the device by ensuring only software with the right privilege can access them. The interface to the hardware-level privilege controls of a processor are often managed by the OS, such as Linux, but they can also be controlled even if a device does not use a complex OS (for example, if it uses a simple function executive, or cut-down RToS, instead). Whenever possible, keep the use of root or supervisor-level privileges in embedded systems to an absolute minimum, and maintain secret data, such as cryptographic keys, at the highest level of privilege (hardest to access). Similar rules hold true for apps and cloud-based systems: keep the use of elevated privileges to a minimum, and try to isolate functions as their own user or privilege set.', 3),

This includes code that may not be normally executed; even if the code is not used, having it within the device can lead to security problems down the road. For similar reasons, it is essential to remove debug and development code from the device prior to shipping. This is often done with isolating “ifdef” statements, which can automatically remove such features during compile time. Although it is understandable to want features in the code in case there are problems in production, it is often more likely that such features will become a source of vulnerability as they provide access and information that would not normally be provided in the end-user environment.', 3),

In that context, it is crucial that we ensure devices only do what we programmed them to do, and ensure that others cannot reprogram them to behave maliciously. In other words, the first step in protecting a device is to protect the code to be sure the device only boots and runs code that you want it running. Fortunately, many chipmakers already build “secure boot” capabilities into their chips. Similarly, for “higher level” code, a number of time-proven, opensource, and client-side libraries like OpenSSL can easily be used to check signatures of code, and accept code only if it comes from an authorized source. In that context, signing firmware, boot images, and higherlevel embedded code are all increasingly common, including signing the underlying software components such as any operating system, and not just applications, but all code on the device. This approach can ensure that all critical components, sensors, actuators, controllers, and relays are all properly configured to only run signed code and never run unsigned code.', 'https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/white-papers/iot-security-reference-architecture-en.pdf', 'Protecting DevicesProtecting the Code that Drives IoT', 1),

Validating all of the different files, scripts, etc. that go into ensuring a complex OS runs correctly is complicated. Potential solutions include the validation of the device bootloader (from a hardware root of trust, which requires support in the processor being used) and then using that bootloader to validate an OS image which is unpacked and installed. Of course, this all takes time. But it is useful to prevent things like Ransomware which may look to install software that renders a device inoperative until a ransom amount is paid.', 3),

The requirements presented in this deliverable are potentially relevant for any concrete architecture derived from the IoT ARM, as they are based both on stakeholder requirements representing a typical mixture of relevant industrial domains and on internal requirements that were derived based on technical constraints. Likewise, the original requirements were gathered based on different architectural backgrounds and levels of abstraction, so that the final integration should be relevant for the work on diverse concrete architectures. The final list of require-ments that is presented in this document is also referred to as the Unified Requirements, because of the different origins that the requirements stem from and that were integrated and iterated upon during the course of the project. The term Unified Requirements is used as name for the list of the IoT ARM requirements.';

These state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructures provide the means to gather detailed information, which should be used by prosumers and processed to make decisions about the optimal production, generation, distribution and consumption of energy.\r\nThe deployment of the Automatic Metering Infrastructure (AMI) will cause an inadvertent amount of information rich almost in real time (daily consumption of electrical energy, maximum demand of energy, demand of last interval, load profile, voltage value, profile of voltage, voltage registers ...) and we believe that there is a definite need to address advanced ways of using this available information.\r\nSCRATCh is based on the application of AI and Big Data analysis on the large amount of data collected by Smart Grid. The application of these techniques is another step that allows reasoning, knowledge gathering, intelligent planning and learning to efficiently manage security infractions. Four applications have been identified and will be addressed to verify the functioning of the demonstrator:\r\n·	Income protection that involves the early detection of energy losses, possibly linked to fraud.\r\n·	Response demand, allowing customers to increase or decrease their energy consumption to balance the system load\r\n·	Management of interruptions, where AMI data is used for the early detection of interruptions and to help early restoration.\r\n·	Predictive analysis of network behavior, this aims to predict the future behavior of the network as a result of the analysis of AMI data.\r\n', ''),
